## [0.2.0-Pre-Alpha] - 2026-09-02

First tagged release. Full rewrite of the frontend shell on the new "Liquid
Glass" design system — GUI, routing, theming, settings, and the adaptive
card dashboard. Download/convert/AI engines are not wired in yet (Alpha
phase).

### Changed

- Removed the Flat theme entirely — the theme engine now ships with two
  modes, **Glass** and **Monochrome**, instead of three.
- Removed several AI-generated-UI design clichés identified in an explicit
  design audit: all-caps labels, middle-dot separators, and identical
  nested cards (converted to divider-lists).
- The card hover-lift/glow effect is now toggleable via the existing
  Reduce Motion setting.
- General code simplification and cleanup: removed a shadowed function
  parameter and deduped repeated styling (GlassTune, StorageCard).

### Fixed

- Multi-layered CSS containing-block bug on the Settings page — the
  category rail now correctly follows scroll, implemented via a React
  portal.
- GlassTune dev-tool theme-leak bug where Glass-only colors bled into
  other themes.
- Assorted Settings layout/scroll issues fixed and re-verified during this
  pass (sticky/fixed rail behavior, hamburger dropdown opacity, banner
  placement, page-transition flash).

### Added

- Hover highlight on Settings interactive controls.
- Dev/debug mode (keybind-gated) with a runtime backdrop-tuning panel
  (GlassTune).

### Verification

- `tsc -b` (typecheck), `vite build` (production build), and `oxlint`
  were run clean at each step of this pass, with a final code-audit
  checkpoint commit confirming no regressions.
